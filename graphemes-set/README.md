# Readme

The script in this directory is used to pull data from the [First-Peoples-Cultural-Council/unicode-resources GitHub repo](https://github.com/First-Peoples-Cultural-Council/unicode-resources) and format it into a CSV file that represents a standard graphemes set.

## Install

- Use the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`
- `npm i` to install the script dependencies from `package.json`

## Run

- `npm run start` to run the script

- `Character`: the grapheme as it was pulled from the `unicode-resources` repo
- `NFD`: [Unicode Normalization Form](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/) D (Canonical Decomposition)
- `NFC`: Unicode Normalization Form C (Canonical Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition)
- `NFD Escaped`: Escaped Unicode string representation of the NFD grapheme
- `NFC Escaped`: Escaped Unicode string representation of the NFC grapheme
- `NFD Code Points`: Unicode code point representation of the NFD grapheme (space-separated)
- `NFC Code Points`: Unicode code point representation of the NFC grapheme (space-separated)
- `AnyAscii`: ASCII representation of the grapheme generated by [AnyAscii](https://github.com/anyascii/anyascii)
